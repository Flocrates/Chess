#Chess Game

This game is made with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and Websockets for a real time chess game.

My intention is to make the game portable and be created from calling one Javascript function and including one CSS stylesheet. Therefore it would allow others to embed this game. I also want to make it customizable (appearance, size, etc.) however it is a long way from that.
